# Playground

Place personal experiments here so they are kept separate from the library code.

Suggested workflow
- Activate venv: `source ../.venv/bin/activate` (run from this folder) or `source .venv/bin/activate` from repo root.
- Copy/modify example scripts here; avoid committing sensitive data or API keys.
- Run a script: `python btc_sma.py`

Notes
- Imports work because the package was installed with `pip install -e .`.
- Keep generated HTML/plots outside version control; they can be large and user-specific.
